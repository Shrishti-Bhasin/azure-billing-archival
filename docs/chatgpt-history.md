### Cost Optimization Challenge: Managing Billing Records in Azure Serverless Architecture
We have a serverless architecture in Azure, where one of our services stores billing records in Azure Cosmos DB. The system is read-heavy, but records older than three months are rarely accessed.

Over the past few years, the database size has significantly grown, leading to increased costs. We need an efficient way to reduce costs while maintaining data availability.

Current System Constraints
Record Size: Each billing record can be as large as 300 KB.

Total Records: The database currently holds over 2 million records.

Access Latency: When an old record is requested, it should still be served, with a response time in the order of seconds.

Solution Requirements
Please propose a detailed solution to optimize costs while ensuring the following
Simplicity & Ease of Implementation – The solution should be straightforward to deploy and maintain.

No Data Loss & No Downtime – The transition should be seamless, without losing any records or requiring2 service downtime.

No Changes to API Contracts – The existing read/write APIs for billing records must remain unchanged

Bonus Points
Include an architecture diagram illustrating your proposed solution.

Provide pseudocode, commands, or scripts for implementing core logic (such as data archival, retrieval, and cost optimization st rategies).

Kindly propose a solution that is best suited for the above use case considering all the production based scenarios. Consider the different problems we might face, how we would tackle them, and how we would fix them if we were to run your solution in a production environment that could impact thousands of users.

Here's a production-grade cost optimization solution for managing billing records in Azure Cosmos DB under a serverless architecture, while meeting your requirements and anticipating edge cases:

✅ High-Level Solution Overview
We'll introduce a tiered storage strategy:

Keep recent (≤3 months) billing records in Azure Cosmos DB.

Move older (>3 months) billing records to Azure Blob Storage in compressed JSON or Parquet format.

Implement a Durable Azure Function that:

Periodically archives old records.

Handles smart retrieval: serves from Cosmos DB first, then Blob if not found.

Expose same APIs through a Smart Fallback Layer to ensure backward compatibility.

🧠 Smart Retrieval Logic (Fallback API)
Read from Cosmos DB → if not found → read from Blob → (optional) cache in Cosmos DB.

✅ Benefits
No API changes.

Seamless fallback.

Efficient cost reduction.

🧾 Core Components & Details
1. Archival Logic (Durable Function)
Triggered by a TimerTrigger (e.g., daily).

Steps:

Query Cosmos DB for records older than 3 months.

Serialize and compress the records (e.g., GZIP+JSON or Parquet).

Upload to Azure Blob Storage (container = billing-archive/yyyy-mm).

Delete the archived records from Cosmos DB.

Pseudocode:

python
Copy
Edit
for record in cosmos_db.query("SELECT * FROM Billing WHERE _ts < three_months_ago"):
    blob_name = f"{record['customerId']}/{record['invoiceId']}.json.gz"
    compressed = gzip_compress(json.dumps(record))
    blob_storage.upload(blob_name, compressed)
    cosmos_db.delete(record['id'])
2. Smart Fallback API
A proxy layer within the existing billing service.

Read Path:

python
Copy
Edit
def get_billing_record(id):
    result = cosmos_db.read(id)
    if result:
        return result
    else:
        blob = blob_storage.get(f"{customer_id}/{invoice_id}.json.gz")
        return json.loads(gzip_decompress(blob))
Write Path:
Unchanged — writes still go to Cosmos DB.

⚠️ Edge Cases & Mitigation
Potential Issue	Mitigation Strategy
Partial Failure in Archival	Use Durable Functions with retry policies. Log to App Insights.
Blob Retrieval Latency > 2s	Cache frequently accessed old records back to Cosmos DB ("lazy hydration").
Data Consistency During Migration	Use ETag/versioning on Cosmos DB. Use transaction batch when deleting.
Blob Access Failure	Use retry + fallback circuit breaker. Alert if persistent.
Data Schema Evolution	Include schema version in metadata when writing to blob.
Billing API Spike on Cold Data	Use Azure CDN with Blob Storage if archived data is frequently accessed.

🔒 Security Considerations
Use Managed Identity for Durable Function to access Blob.

Configure RBAC and Private Endpoints for secure storage access.

Enable Soft Delete for both Cosmos and Blob to prevent accidental loss.

🔄 CI/CD & Automation
Deploy Durable Function via Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.

Set up automated tests to validate retrieval.

Monitor archival activity with App Insights and custom logs.

📊 Monitoring & Alerting
Use Application Insights to:
Track archival job success/failure

Monitor fallback read % from Blob

Alert if read latency exceeds SLA (e.g., 3s)

Dashboard:

Daily records archived

Total cold storage usage

% of fallback reads
